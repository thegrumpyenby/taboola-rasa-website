<h1>Taboola Rasa is a non-profit mental health advocacy project</h1>
<p>Our goal is to create awareness for mental health experiences and to end the stigma and discrimination associated with mental health concerns. We’re changing the bigger picture, one story at a time.</p>

<p>We will soon start publishing interviews with people who are open to sharing their own stories. We also publish articles <a href="/blog">on our blog</a> that otherwise explain mental health experiences. If you’re interested in participating, please <a href="/participate">let us know</a>.</p>
