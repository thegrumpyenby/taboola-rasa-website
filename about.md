# What Taboola Rasa Is & What We Do
Taboola Rasa is a non-profit mental health advocacy project. Our main goal is to create awareness for mental health experiences and end the shame, judgement, stigma and discrimination associated with mental health concerns.

We publish interviews with people who are sharing their mental health experiences. In a way, every mental health experience is unique, but the individual stories we tell also share common themes that help shape a broader image of mental health in society.

## Changing the Bigger Picture, One Story at a Time
In our experience, just one person opening up about their own mental health story can give others the support they need to approach their own concerns and potentially get help. Hearing and seeing someone else speak openly about mental health takes a lot of the judgement and shame away.

We also publish articles on our blog that otherwise explain mental health experiences, debunk some of the myths surrounding mental health, or simply give more information, provide resources or refer to current events or media reports.
